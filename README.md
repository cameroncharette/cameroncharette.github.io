  <h2> A history of the Tree</h2>
  <p> The year was 2017, the place was Worcester State Universtiy, the Chandler was 13. Kad was still fat, Joe still had hair and Bunyon's Nana was Italian. The older, more responsible, football athletes who lived upstairs but used the downstairs handicap bathroom were Bunyon, Cam, Jordy, Koss and Kad. The immature non-athletic friend group who moved in downstairs shortly after was Colin, Steve, Joe, Thomas & Juma (Rip). Several unassuming months went by and both friend groups remained fairly isolated. The first interactions werent great, such as when Joe and Thomas threw a Party and Koss was asleep upstairs but still had his one card taken and had to appear for a hearing. Eventually one night the ice broken over Adrian Peterson's relentless pursuit of underage women. You seen Cameron's girlfriend met the Saint's Football team at a bar in London when they were playing overseas. He gave her his number and she gave it to Cameron. </p>
