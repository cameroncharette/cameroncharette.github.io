           <h2> A History of the Tree</h2>
           <p> The year was 2017, the place was Worcester State Universtiy, the Chandler was 13. Kad was still fat, Joe still had hair and Bunyon's Nana was Italian. The older, more responsible, football athletes who lived upstairs but used the downstairs handicap bathroom were Bunyon, Cam, Jordy, Koss and Kad. The immature non-athletic regualr people friend group who moved in downstairs shortly after were Colin, Steve, Joe, Thomas, Christian & Juma (Rip). Several unassuming months went by and both friend groups remained fairly isolated. The first interactions weren't great, like when Joe and Steve threw a Party and Koss was asleep upstairs, but when the RAs kicked down the door he still had his one card taken and had to appear for a hearing. Eventually though, one night the ice broke over Adrian Peterson's relentless pursuit of underage women. </p>    
           <p>You see, Cam's girlfriend met the Saint's Football team at a bar in London on a school trip when they were playing overseas. Adrian gave her his number and she gave it to Cam. Naturally, the upstairs group abused this privliged information. The night she met him, we facetimed him * hyperlink to video here or screenshot*. He picked up and then quickly hung up once he realized we didn't have boobs, and we thought that was the end of that. Until, he texted us back in the morning. Apparently, he was so drunk he didnt remeber the FaceTime and thught my phone number was my girlfriends...so we played along. Over the next several MONTHS the upstairs group conducted what has to rival the Manti Te'o catfish scheme. Another female students instagram was used *with her permission* to be face of the operation. We convinced Adrian that she went to London with Cameron's girlfriend (she didn't) and the game was afoot.</p>
           <p>Through the middle of this, one historic night, the upstairs group shared a few beers with the downstairs group. During the night, Adrian Peterson texted Cam back and naturally the story came up in conversation. As we retold the story the TheTrustTree seed was planted. </p>
